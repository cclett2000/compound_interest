***PROGRAMMERS GUIDE*** DUE TUESDAY 8/26
1) Structure: (Loops, If Statements, Classes, Packages(ex: java.util.*))
    ***KEYBOARD***
    > Scanner (java.util.*)
        - The scanner package was used so that when the user inputs data into the program it is stored and able
          to be used later in calculation
    ***FILE***
    > Loop
        - The loop used during the file input method was used to store the values found in the 'testing.txt'
          file in an ArrayList. Reason being that the scanner used to read in the file reads line by line and by
          directing it to store the data in an ArrayList...continue
